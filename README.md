# 42sp: Basecamp

42 is a school of French origin that offers an education proposal different from what we are used to.

The basecamp lasted 3 intense weeks where there was no teacher, only people interested in learning and teaching.

The proposal was to test us with lists of exercises in Shell and C. Every Friday there was an individual exam and soon after, we were selected with random people in a group of 3 for a project during the weekend.

Some exercises are not working well but they were done and here is my log.
